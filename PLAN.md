# OpenShowQt: implementation plan

Accepted 2026-10-21; condensed and audited 2026-10-29.
Current checkpoint and verification: [PROGRESS.md](PROGRESS.md).
Current code boundaries and open differences: [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md).
Detailed completed-task evidence: [history](docs/history/README.md).

## Goal and reference

Build a Linux-first C++/Qt presentation application closely reproducing FreeShow's
core operator screens: service playlists, lyrics, visual editing, images, video,
audio, operator previews and one audience display.

Reference: `/home/jim/FreeShow`, FreeShow 1.6.7 at
`436d4b634878ba723da1d1373637384ec700ce16`. Leave that clone unchanged.
The normal operator setup uses the second display for the projector; when it is
unplugged, physical-output checks remain open. The original 12–16 engineer-week
estimate is historical; re-estimate remaining work before productization.

## Fixed architecture and interfaces

- **Frontend:** Qt 6 Quick/QML with C++ document/model adapters, persistence and
  worker supervision. It owns all editable documents and package writes.
- **Domain and scenes:** Qt-independent C++20 Documents/History/storage plus
  immutable compiled scenes with resolved styles, geometry and local asset paths.
  Boost.JSON is the shared JSON implementation.
- **Worker:** separate Qt-free process owning GLFW output, Vulkan instance/device,
  swapchain and synchronization; vk-bootstrap setup, Skia Ganesh/Vulkan composition,
  SkParagraph with real ICU text support, FFmpeg decode/conversion/resampling.
- **Scheduling:** decoding, RPC and rendering have separate execution contexts.
  Files, decode, IPC and preview consumers must not block presentation or audio
  callbacks. This is still a target: **6.9a/b remain TODO**.
- **RPC:** length-prefixed JSON-RPC 2.0 on Unix-domain sockets; Qt local sockets
  in the frontend and a raw socket/poll loop in the worker. Version/capability
  negotiation, request IDs, structured errors and acknowledged revisions. Traffic
  carries bounded scene/control metadata and paths, never original/decoded media.
- **Preview:** composed worker pixels through three POSIX shared-memory slots;
  exact stream/sequence ready-release ownership. Normally 640×360 at up to 15 fps
  on content changes; selected editor scenes and on-demand thumbnails are bounded
  separately. Drop/defer previews under load; never overwrite a consumer-owned slot.
- **Audio:** native PipeWire, F32 stereo at negotiated rate, independent gain/mute
  for video and one standalone track. The original design uses one software-mixed
  stream; production currently uses two independent transports/streams. **6.20 must
  reconcile this explicitly.** Audio is the clock when running, monotonic otherwise.
- **Output state:** SceneStore owns prepared scenes and desired/landed/published
  commands. The frame loop captures once; status only credits a successfully
  presented frame. A separate SceneFrame fixes scene/blends/time/revision for
  drawing the audience and its mirror preview.
- **Recovery:** a restarted worker begins black and requires explicit presentation.
  Destination removal must disable output until explicitly reselected. Complete
  crash/device/display recovery remains **7.1a–c**.
- **Storage:** versioned JSON service directory with stable IDs and sibling assets;
  relative package references, staged durable saves, separate recovery autosave,
  bounded undo/redo. Background autosave is implemented; explicit saves still
  execute on the UI thread.
- **Editor:** worker-rendered selected scene beneath QML selection handles; text
  entered in inspectors, with final text layout owned by Skia.
- **Scope:** Linux, one SDR audience output, stereo audio, multiple text/image
  items, move/resize/order, typography, groups, reusable styles, backgrounds,
  cuts/crossfades and media playback. Video holds its final frame when not looping.
  Software decode is supported; optional VA-API and direct Vulkan-backed software
  decode were added during M1, with an explicit copying fallback.
- **Deferred:** FreeShow import/round-trip, stage/scripture/additional outputs,
  Vulkan display-plane output, advanced effects, remote control, streaming,
  NDI/SDI, cloud services, Windows and macOS.

### Output layer model

The original control model is **background → images → words → aux → clock**;
aux/clock default off in production. Disabled layers skip drawing. Audio is a
playback source, never a composition layer. Runtime toggles take effect without
GPU/swapchain recreation.

Audience composition draws directly into one target with no per-layer targets
or `saveLayer`; fades use shader/paint composition. Preview/snapshot targets and
cached CPU blur backdrops are separate resources. Skia application dependencies
use public core/Ganesh/module APIs only. Source guards enforce these constraints.

Production foreground images and text currently share one authored item stack
under the words layer; the images layer paints only the development decoration.
Independent image/word controls versus mixed z ordering must be resolved in
**6.20**, not hidden by a documentation rewrite.

### Responsibility boundaries

OutputSession coordinates window/device/swapchain, frame capture and presentation.
SceneRenderer owns layers/transitions; SceneStore owns command/scene truth.
Preview production, background transport, frontend RPC/consumer/supervisor and
save/UI components have explicit pending extraction tasks. Development fixtures
must drive those production seams; commands must not manipulate hard-coded demo
state. Keep a single document/history owner and a single worker text renderer.

Skia is pinned in `third_party/skia`; the build recipe and configuration live in
`scripts/build-skia.sh` and `cmake/OpenShowSkia.cmake`. Dependency setup, system
versions and old probe results are in the archive; package notices/build manifest
remain **7.3**. Do not use old machine paths as current dependency configuration.

## Task, pause and Git rules

1. Work in milestone/dependency order. Preserve recorded DONE checkpoints;
   later work does not waive earlier open tasks. **6.9a/b are outstanding**;
   the previously recorded next extraction is **6.18a2** and already has untracked
   preparation. Finish/check that boundary without claiming scheduling completion.
2. Aim for half a day to two days per leaf; split larger tasks before starting.
   A parent is DONE only when every child passes its acceptance.
3. Use TODO, IN PROGRESS, BLOCKED and DONE. Separate authored work, passing tests
   and physical verification. M0–M5 are historical implementation checkpoints,
   not proof that the later review gaps or M7 release gates are closed.
4. Keep each task independently reviewable and commit-ready; unfinished features
   stay disabled or behind development options. Preserve unrelated working files.
5. Before pausing update PROGRESS.md with current task, changes, checks, blockers
   and exact next action. Keep it a handoff; put lasting contracts in architecture
   documentation and long completed logs in history, without duplicating the ledger.
6. At milestones run acceptance and propose a commit message/file summary. The user
   controls commits/tags unless explicitly delegated. Include docs with code;
   exclude generated output, fetched dependencies, caches and personal/media files.
7. Resume by reading PLAN.md/PROGRESS.md and inspecting Git status/history.
8. Keep PLAN.md concise and stable. Update task statuses as work proceeds, but
   do not add or expand implementation details. Change work-item descriptions
   only when additional work items are needed or a section must be split into
   multiple work items; keep those additions brief. Record implementation notes,
   decisions and verification results in PROGRESS.md, architecture documentation
   or history as appropriate, without copying them into this plan.

## Work breakdown

Each DONE row records the deliverable and regression entry point. Historical
measurements and detailed acceptance are preserved in [the archive](docs/history/README.md).
The current audit distinguishes architecture matches from remaining differences.

| 0.4 | DONE | Establish CMake targets and dependencies | UI and Qt-free worker skeletons build reproducibly |
| 0.5 | DONE | Record dependency versions and asset notices | Skia revision/settings and dependencies are recorded |

Checkpoint: `M0: establish project plan and build foundation`.

| ID | Status | Work | Acceptance |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1.1 | DONE | GLFW/Vulkan window and Skia rendering | Text and image render correctly |
| 1.2 | DONE | Worker launch, RPC handshake and shutdown | Runtime seam and acknowledged commands; disconnect stops worker |
| 1.2a | DONE | Session seam: frame loop out of `main.cpp` into `OutputSession` | `--render-test` presents unchanged; all checks green |
| 1.2b | DONE | Wire framing and JSON-RPC envelope in `openshow::protocol` | Round-trip, fragmentation, oversize and malformed-input tests pass |
| 1.2c | DONE | Worker RPC server thread on `--socket PATH` | Handshake completes; worker exits on `shutdown` and on disconnect |
| 1.2d | DONE | Live RPC commands driving the seam | A socket command changes visible output on the next frame |
| 1.2e | DONE | Frontend supervision: spawn, handshake, shutdown | UI shows worker state; closing the UI terminates the worker |
| 1.3 | DONE | Display selection and swapchain recreation | Automated switching verified historically; projector checks remain M7 |
| 1.3a | DONE | Session display operations: list and select applied on the render thread | Selecting a destination moves the output and rebuilds the swapchain at the new extent |
| 1.3b | DONE | RPC surface: `output.displays`, `output.select`, monitor fields in status | A socket command moves the output between panels |
| 1.3c | DONE | Frontend destination picker | Dropdown in the UI moves the audience output |
| 1.3d | DONE | Automated display-switch acceptance | Historical eDP/DP/windowed checks; manual drag-resize remains open |

VA-API transfer writes mapped staging memory but **still performs an FFmpeg CPU frame copy**; software decode copies/interleaves or converts. This path is now an explicitly permitted startup fallback (`--allow-video-copy`), not direct decode. | Original GPU sampler and staging tests retained; High10 software compatibility conversion tested. |

### M6 — Code review remediation and architecture

The [M6 review](docs/M6-code-review.md) introduced R1–R19; **6.0** completed
the review only. Productization moved to **M7**; old 6.1–6.4 reliability
references in historical logs/source mean 7.1–7.4. M6 remains incomplete.

| 6.9a | TODO | Move file decode/probe preparation off the single RPC loop into a bounded cancellable executor | Slow prepare does not delay status/clear/releases/shutdown; readiness/error/cancellation are explicit; disconnect/superseded work retires without growth. R10 |
| 6.9b | TODO | Prepare bounded media/text/blur resources before go; move transport start/pre-roll/retirement waits off the render loop, preserving Ganesh ownership | Slow video open/audio pre-roll/old teardown cannot freeze active output; ready still and video changes meet p95 100 ms measured at the frame boundary; superseded primed transports are bounded. R10 |

| 6.18a2 | TODO | Extract `PreviewProducer` from `OutputSession` (second half of 6.18a) | The preview stream's lifecycle, the thumbnail queue/decode/eviction policy, the selection state and the audience-budget policy get one owner with its own thread rules, next to `SceneStore`; the session keeps only the handoff (frame in, slot out). Regression gates unchanged, no second owner of a frame's revision. R5/R11/R13 |
| 6.18b | TODO | Extract background transport lifecycle from OutputSession and move bench/diagnostic drivers out of worker main | Narrow renderer/transport handoff with bounded prepared resources; session no longer owns transport internals; production and bench exercise the same runtime.

Checkpoint: `M6: close code review and graduate production architecture`.

### M7 — Productization, reliability and installable alpha

These release gates remain open regardless of historical milestone tags.

| ID | Status | Work | Acceptance |
|---|---|---|---|
| 7.1a | TODO | Worker supervision and bounded restart/shutdown; reset decoder, requests, timers, previews and acknowledged state per connection | Kill/disconnect/hang/restart tests preserve editable documents, clear stale UI imagery/state and start uniformly black; explicit presentation required to go live |
| 7.1b | TODO | Device/surface/swapchain failure classification and recovery; check all Vulkan/Skia results and bound waits | Fault-injected submit/acquire/device loss cannot busy-loop, wait forever or claim success; device/session rebuild has explicit safe output state |
| 7.1c | TODO | Stable display identity/hotplug handling, disabled output on destination removal and refreshed UI display inventory | Unplug/replug/reorder cannot silently move audience output onto another display; explicit destination selection re-enables it; projector Wayland/X11 checks recorded |
| 7.2 | TODO | Playback/rendering diagnostics and measurable resource budgets | Frame/decode/upload/readback timing, source clock, signed A/V drift, dropped/held frames, queue/cache bytes, failures and transport restart counters inspectable; diagnostics do not block realtime paths |
| 7.3 | TODO | Package application with reproducible dependency/build manifest and notices | Both executables/resources/fonts run on clean Fedora with no build-tree path; matching public Skia/ICU artifacts, Qt/FFmpeg and other notices/licences included |
| 7.4 | TODO | Full service rehearsal, target-machine performance and acceptance fixes | Complete acceptance suite below: one-hour mixed service without growth, 10-minute deadline and 30-minute A/V gates, missing/corrupt media and recovery, physical second-display acceptance on Wayland and X11; remaining fixes get focused tasks |

Checkpoint: `M7: deliver installable presentation alpha`.

## Acceptance and verification

Record actual verification commands/results for every task. Use focused tests
for domain behaviour, persistence and IPC, rendering fixtures for layout, and
physical hardware for display/media acceptance.

- Documents: round-trips, undo/redo, interrupted saves, recovery, missing media,
  unsupported document versions.
- RPC: fragmented/invalid messages, version mismatch, disconnect and restart.
- Rendering: fixed fonts, Unicode, scaling, fit modes, transitions and preview/
  output consistency.
- UI: agreed captures at fixed sizes; keyboard navigation, drag/drop, mixed DPI.
- Media: play/pause/seek/loop, silent video, video audio plus music, malformed
  files and end-of-file behaviour.
- Performance: 1080p60 composition with source-rate video, under 1% missed
  presentation deadlines in ten minutes on this PC with previews enabled.
- Responsiveness: preloaded slide changes within 100 ms at the 95th percentile.
- Synchronization: steady A/V offset within 50 ms over thirty minutes.
- Reliability: one-hour mixed service without growing queues, sustained memory
  growth or unexpected output changes.
- Displays: any check that needs an audience output — 1.3 display selection and
  swapchain recreation, output placement, fit modes and transitions on a real
  panel — requires the projector on the second display. With it unplugged those
  checks stay open; evidence gathered from an off-screen output window is logged
  and labelled as such, and does not satisfy them.
- Platforms: physical-display checks on Fedora Wayland and X11. Headless checks
  supplement these and cannot replace them.

Each milestone handoff records what works, remaining limitations, passing checks
and the next task. Never claim physical or runtime verification from static checks.
