# OpenShowQt progress and session handoff

Updated: 2026-10-22 (Europe/London).

## Current checkpoint

- Milestone: **M1 — Prove frontend-to-renderer integration**, task **1.1**
  DONE on 2026-10-22. M0 was closed earlier the same day: annotated tag
  `M0` created at tip `bca7cee` and pushed (commits and tags are delegated
  to the agent for this session).
- Task 1.1: the Qt-free worker opens a GLFW window on native Wayland,
  builds a Vulkan device with vk-bootstrap, creates a Skia Ganesh
  `GrDirectContext`, wraps the swapchain images as Skia surfaces and
  composites the test scene through the layer stack. **Accepted on screen**:
  fullscreen on the second display (DP-4 1920x1200@60) at the native
  extent, legible SkParagraph text and the SkCodec photo, ~59.4 fps
  FIFO-paced (1188 frames in 20 s, exit 0), letterboxed exactly as the
  output rule prescribes for a 16:9 canvas on a 16:10 panel; the user
  confirmed seeing it. Evidence: `/tmp/opencode/native2-dp.png` plus the
  render-test log. (Earlier in the day: 277 frames at fullscreen on eDP-1
  once the swapchain transfer-usage bug was fixed, and the first-ever GPU
  frames in a normal window.)
- Rendering is built on the new **output layer model** (PLAN.md): every
  frame is composited bottom-to-top from background, images, words, aux and
  clock layers in a single pass with no render-to-texture; disabled layers
  are skipped without dispatch. ctest `render_layer_composition` verifies
  this on the CPU.
- Checks: `ctest --preset desktop` passes **7 of 7** (adds
  `render_scene_snapshot` and `render_layer_composition`);
  `ctest --preset headless` passes **6 of 6**; `worker_is_qt_free` stayed
  green throughout.
- The screen-lock and unplugged-DP-4 incident that blocked visual
  verification earlier was resolved when the user unlocked and reconnected
  the display; nothing was bypassed.
- Next: task **1.2** (launch the worker from the frontend, RPC handshake,
  clean shutdown).

## Completed work

- Renamed the documentation from the working title FreeShowQt to OpenShowQt and
  rewrote `README.md`. Upstream FreeShow references are untouched.
- Checked the Git remote, its reachability and the ignore rules (task 0.2).
- Replaced SDL3 with GLFW plus vk-bootstrap for the worker's output window and
  native PipeWire for audio, after inspecting `/home/jim/sloppy-ui`.
- Dropped Asio and nlohmann/json in favour of a `poll()` loop and Boost.JSON.
- Recorded dependencies, licences and the Skia findings (task 0.5).
- Added the build skeleton (task 0.4):

| Path | Product |
|---|---|
| `CMakeLists.txt`, `CMakePresets.json` | top level, `desktop` and `headless` presets |
| `cmake/OpenShowSkia.cmake` | `openshow::skia` from a GN-built Skia tree |
| `src/domain` | `openshow::domain`, Qt-free, version only so far |
| `src/protocol` | `openshow::protocol`, Qt-free, protocol constants and a Boost.JSON offer |
| `src/worker` | `openshow-worker`, Qt-free, `--check-deps` reports linked libraries, `--socket` returns exit 3 as not built yet |
| `src/ui` | `openshow-ui`, Qt 6 Quick window with placeholder text |
| `tests` | domain and protocol tests, an `ldd` based Qt-dependency guard, worker `--check-deps` |

- Derived `docs/reference.md` from the FreeShow source for task 0.3: shell and
  panel geometry, theme tokens, pages and drawer tabs, the show page playlist and
  slide grid, the full keyboard map with its gating rules, output and compositing
  semantics including background continuity, the saved data model and storage
  layout, and a mapping from FreeShow's operation surface to our planned RPC.
- Confirmed the FreeShow renderer is **Svelte**, not Vue, and corrected the
  earlier note here. 547 `.svelte` and 466 `.ts` files under `src/`.
- Verified that document against the running app and fixed what it had wrong:
  resize snapping is 100.05 / 200.1 / 290±20 capped at 638, not the numbers first
  transcribed from source; `F5` advances the output instead of clearing timers, and
  the per-layer timer is cleared by its own button; the drawer search is a
  right-aligned 290x36 field that only exists while open, not a permanent
  `--navigation-width` field; store JSON lives in `<dataPath>/Config/`, and a fresh
  install has digit-to-slide and letter-to-slide **off** by default. Things only the
  running app showed: the right panel above 522px becomes
  `flex-direction: row-reverse`, clearing leaves pure black through an 800ms
  `background-color` transition on the slide box, output scaling is literally CSS
  `zoom = boxWidth / 1920`, the top 5% of an output window is an
  `-webkit-app-region: drag` strip, an off-screen output window keeps rendering
  live DOM, `Esc` with a selection never clears the output because the presenter
  path fires at 0ms against a 20ms deselect, and the serialised `out` buffer is
  persisted inside the output object so a restart re-presents what was on air.

## Task 1.1 log (2026-10-22)

New worker sources: `src/worker/output/OutputWindow.{h,cpp}`,
`VulkanContext.{h,cpp}`, `Swapchain.{h,cpp}`, `src/worker/render/Layer.{h,cpp}`,
`render/TestScene.{h,cpp}` and a rewritten `main.cpp` with
`--render-test [--monitor N] [--seconds S]`, `--snapshot PATH`,
`--list-monitors`, `--check-layers` and repeatable `--disable-layer` /
`--enable-layer` toggles. Findings, in the order they bit:

- **GLFW on Wayland:** `glfwInitHint(GLFW_PLATFORM, GLFW_PLATFORM_WAYLAND)`
  with an `ANY_PLATFORM` fallback; confirmed "GLFW platform wayland" at
  runtime. `--list-monitors` saw both panels while DP-4 was attached
  (`eDP-1 2256x1504@60`, `DP-4 1920x1200@60`, content-scale 2.0).
- **ICU mismatch:** the prebuilt `libskunicode_icu.a` wants ICU v77 versioned
  symbols; this Fedora has 78. Decision: use the hard-coded SkUnicode backend
  plus a compat `SkUnicodes::ICU::Make()` shim (libskshaper calls it
  unconditionally). Full-ICU resolution is deferred to M3, together with
  proper line breaking and bidi.
- **Line-break flags:** my first `computeCodeUnitFlags` placed the hard-break
  flag *on* the newline; ICU's UTF-8 path puts it on the position *after*,
  which silently swallowed one character per line ("OpenShowQ", "SkParagrah").
  Fixed and verified by snapshot: Greek, em dash and accented text all render
  with no dropped characters and no tofu.
- **Skia Vulkan backend context (MakeVulkan returned null):** this Skia
  revision *requires* `fMemoryAllocator`
  (`skgpu::VulkanMemoryAllocators::Make` from the private header, as
  sloppy-ui does) and wants `fVkExtensions` and `fDeviceFeatures2` populated
  from vk-bootstrap's enabled device extensions/features. Instance
  extensions are not checked (this vk-bootstrap has no
  `Instance::get_enabled_extensions`; pass 0/nullptr like sloppy-ui).
- **Wayland surface extent:** immediately after fullscreen,
  `currentExtent` is `0xFFFFFFFF` (undefined until the compositor configures
  the surface). The swapchain now falls back to the GLFW framebuffer size and
  relies on the loop's OUT_OF_DATE recreate; the frame loop also recreates
  whenever the framebuffer size changes.
- **`WrapBackendRenderTarget` returned null for every image:** the cause was
  *not* the format pairing — diagnostics printed `format 37
  (B8G8R8A8_UNORM), colorType 4 (kBGRA_8888), target valid 1`. The actual
  gate is this Skia's `check_image_info` (GrVkGpu.cpp), which requires wrapped
  images to carry **both** `VK_IMAGE_USAGE_TRANSFER_SRC_BIT` and
  `VK_IMAGE_USAGE_TRANSFER_DST_BIT`. My swapchain requested only
  COLOR_ATTACHMENT|TRANSFER_DST; sloppy-ui's includes TRANSFER_SRC. Adding
  `TRANSFER_SRC` fixed the wrap, and the fullscreen run then presented 277
  frames and exited 0 — the whole GLFW→vk-bootstrap→Skia→WSI path works. The
  chosen-format↔colorType mapping was also made SRGB-safe and a diagnostic
  dump of the offered surface formats stays on the failure path.
- **Layer model implemented the same day** (user requirement, recorded in
  PLAN.md "Output layer model"): `LayerStack`/`RenderLayer` with z-ordered
  layers and enable bits; `TestScene` rebuilt as five layers —
  background/image/words/aux-placeholder/clock — drawn straight into the
  target surface, audio excluded as a playback-only source. Aux starts off.
  `--check-layers` proves on the CPU: all-off is pure black (skipped layers
  dispatch nothing), each enabled layer paints only inside its declared
  region, and re-toggling returns byte-identical frames. Default snapshot is
  pixel-identical in composition to the pre-layer scene.
- **Accepted on screen later the same day** (screen unlocked, DP-4 back):
  three more bugs stood between "presenting" and "correct on the panel",
  all found with the user watching the live window:
  - The scene *shrank every frame*. The swapchain surface hands out the
    same `SkCanvas` each frame and Skia keeps its matrix, so the
    per-frame `translate`+`scale` of the output rule compounded
    (×0.9, ×0.81, …) until the scene collapsed into a dot — which is
    also why screenshots read as "solid black". A CPU snapshot renders
    one frame per process and could never show it. Fix:
    `canvas->resetMatrix()` at the top of `TestScene::draw()`.
  - A one-shot `surface->readPixels()` probe at frame 30 (kept in
    `runRenderTest`) was the decisive instrument: pre-fix it showed 15%
    non-black pixels, post-fix 100% — Skia had been writing correctly
    into the wrapped images all along.
  - Fullscreen never got the panel extent: GLFW received no configure
     while the surface stayed unconfigured, so the swapchain lived at the
     1280x720 fallback and KWin upscaled (soft text). Fix: map the window
     *before* `glfwSetWindowMonitor`, pump events until the framebuffer
     matches the monitor mode (≤600 ms), and poll
     `Swapchain::extentOutOfDate()` every 30 frames so a late configure
     still recreates the swapchain at the true extent.
  - Cosmetic: the status line's `U+2714` is missing from Liberation Sans
    and showed as tofu in the text-blob path; the prefix is now plain
    "live:".
  Final acceptance: `--render-test --monitor 1 --seconds 20` created the
  swapchain at native **1920x1200**, presented **1188 frames (~59.4 fps,
  exit 0)**, readback 90% non-black (the authored 1920x1080 canvas
  letterboxed in the 16:10 panel), and the user confirmed the scene on
  the second display (`/tmp/opencode/native2-dp.png`).

## Verification and environment

- 2026-10-22, task 1.1: `ctest --preset desktop` passes **7 of 7** —
  `domain_tests`, `protocol_tests`, `worker_is_qt_free`, `ui_links_qt`,
  `worker_check_deps`, `render_scene_snapshot`, `render_layer_composition`.
  `ctest --preset headless` passes **6 of 6** with the UI off.
  `openshow-worker --render-test --monitor 0 --seconds 14` logged: GLFW
  platform wayland → fullscreen on monitor 0 (eDP-1) 2256x1504@60Hz → device
  "AMD Radeon 890M Graphics (RADV STRIX1)" → swapchain created →
  "presented 277 frames", exit 0. Windowed mode configured 1280x720 logical
  → 1728x972 buffers. Evidence PNGs (snapshot renders) in `/tmp/opencode/`.
- 2026-10-22, environment incident: KDE session 1 `LockedHint=yes` with
  `kscreenlocker_greet` running from ~10:00. While locked,
  `spectacle -b -n -f` returns the last pre-lock frame (the captured clock
  stays at 10:00 while the wall clock advances), and DP-4 was unplugged
  mid-session so `--list-monitors` reports one display. Nothing was visually
  verified during the lock; the locker was deliberately not bypassed.
- `cmake --preset desktop` configures without warnings using CMake 4.3.0,
  Qt 6.11.2, Boost 1.90.0, GLFW 3.4.0, PipeWire 1.6.9, libavcodec 63.1.102 and
  `../skia/out/Release/libskia.a`.
- `cmake --build --preset desktop` completes all 42 steps.
- `ctest --preset desktop` passes 5 of 5: `domain_tests`, `protocol_tests`,
  `worker_is_qt_free`, `ui_links_qt`, `worker_check_deps`.
- `cmake --preset headless`, then its build and test presets pass 4 of 4 with
  `OPENSHOW_BUILD_UI=OFF`, so the worker side genuinely needs no Qt.
- `./build/src/worker/openshow-worker --check-deps` prints GLFW 3.4.0, Vulkan
  header 313, Skia linked with a 2048 KiB font cache limit, PipeWire 1.6.9,
  libavcodec and libavformat 63.1.102, libswscale 10.1.102, libswresample
  7.1.102 and the offer `{"application":"openshow-worker","protocol":[0,1]}`.
- `./build/src/ui/openshow-ui` stays running under `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen`
  and `minimal` with no QML errors, so the module loads. It has not been seen on
  a physical display and nothing has been drawn with Skia yet.
- Two gotchas found. FFmpeg headers carry no `extern "C"` guards, so C++ callers
  must wrap them. Boost.JSON keeps small integers in its signed kind, so a wire
  number needs `is_uint64()` before `as_uint64()`.
- Git: origin `git@github.com:dattrax/OpenShowQt.git`, `main` in sync.
- FreeShow 1.6.7 reference clone `/home/jim/FreeShow` at
  `436d4b634878ba723da1d1373637384ec700ce16`, unchanged, with no installed
  node_modules.
- Every citation path in `docs/reference.md` was checked to exist in the clone:
  69 unique paths, no misses after fixing six wrong prefixes such as
  `EM/output/clear.ts` which is really `src/frontend/components/output/clear.ts`.
  Sampled line numbers were read back and agree, for example the 1920x1080
  `DEFAULT_BOUNDS` at `FS/components/helpers/output.ts:858` and the background
  mount delay `duration / 4 + 20` at
  `FS/components/output/layers/Background.svelte:88`.
- Runtime check of the same document: `third_party/cache/FreeShow-1.6.7-x86_64.AppImage`
  is 165640234 bytes with sha512 base64
  `MsURzL48zjECRkTTvHnmmtF0fu8QO97PTpFL12kayUw/VGdBrAyUMUh5O3qODa7yYhmG1q9bn4lZ3Q+lQ1GyOQ==`,
  equal to the published `latest-linux.yml`. Run with
  `--remote-debugging-port=9222 --user-data-dir=/tmp/opencode/fs/userdata` it
  reports Chrome/138 and Electron/37.10.3. Geometry, colours, DOM structure,
  keyboard gating, persisted settings and timer behaviour were read from the live
  pages; the method and its traps are recorded in `docs/reference.md` §12, and the
  18 PNG captures sit in `third_party/cache/freeshow-visuals/` (Git-ignored). The
  app was killed afterwards and the `Documents/FreeShow` data root it created
  during the run was removed, leaving the machine as found. The driver used for
  this is committed as `tools/cdp-inspect.mjs` and parses cleanly; it is a
  development tool and nothing in the build references it.

## Decisions

- (2026-10-22) Output composition follows the layer model now recorded in
  PLAN.md: one pass, no render-to-texture, disabled layers functionally
  skipped, frontend-toggled; audio is never a composition layer.
- (2026-10-22) Skia Vulkan requirements proven on this revision:
  `fMemoryAllocator` is mandatory; wrapped swapchain images need
  TRANSFER_SRC **and** TRANSFER_DST usage bits; Wayland's undefined
  `currentExtent` is handled with a framebuffer-size fallback plus
  OUT_OF_DATE recreate.
- (2026-10-22) ICU: hard-coded SkUnicode backend plus the
  `SkUnicodes::ICU::Make()` shim until an ICU-v77 match (or a rebuilt Skia)
  lands in M3; ASCII-only break rules are explicitly a task-1.1 scope limit.
- Layout and names as in the table: `openshow-ui` and `openshow-worker` are the
  two shipped executables, with `src/domain` and `src/protocol` Qt-free and
  shared by both.
- The worker must link no Qt. `tests/CheckNoQt.cmake` inspects `ldd` output, and
  the inverted check on the frontend proves the guard is not vacuous.
- The worker gains no SDL dependency: GLFW provides the output window and Vulkan
  surface, vk-bootstrap the instance and device, following `/home/jim/sloppy-ui`.
- Audio is native PipeWire: one stream per worker, software mix of embedded
  video audio with one standalone track, per-source volume and mute, and the
  process callback as clock.
- Sockets and JSON settled: a `poll()` loop on a raw Unix socket and Boost.JSON,
  with no Asio and no nlohmann/json.
- Text layout stays in Skia with SkParagraph. There is no shader toolchain:
  Skia compiles SkSL to SPIR-V in process, so a custom effect is SkSL through
  `SkRuntimeEffect` rather than hand-written SPIR-V.
- No-compositor output through the Vulkan display plane is deferred.
- Keep progress in these tracked files rather than chat memory, and never mark
  authored scaffolding as verified graphics work.

## Output window log

The projector is the second display and it is unplugged, so output behaviour is
logged here from what is observable off screen rather than claimed as seen.

- 2026-10-21, FreeShow 1.6.7, one display attached, output window created but
  never shown (`autoOutput: false`, top-bar output button carrying class
  `display off`):
  - The output window exists as its own page target while hidden **and keeps
    rendering**: after a slide went to air its DOM held the item, after a clear it
    emptied. Reading it as pixels needs `fromSurface: false`. It occupies the
    configured 1920x1080 bounds (1430x805 CSS at scale 1.34375).
  - Off air: `div.slide` with `background-color: black`,
    `transition: 800ms background-color`, `aspect-ratio: 16/9`, no children.
  - On air with the Welcome slide: white bold "Welcome!" centred, captured at
    `third_party/cache/freeshow-visuals/06-output-slide.png`.
  - Cleared with `.`: DOM emptied, still black, "Clear all" became
    "Restore output". Inline `zoom`, the layer list and the 5% drag strip are in
    `docs/reference.md` §7.
  - Timers: a 100ms interval in that occluded, unfocused window fired 50 times in
    5008ms, so nothing is throttled while the audience window is off screen.
  - Still untestable without the projector: placement and mode switching on a real
    panel, per-display DPI, the display-selection precedence of §7, always-on-top
    stacking against a real desktop, and how transitions and the `blur` fit read on
    hardware. These are open for 1.3 and M4.
- To repeat once the projector is connected: capture FreeShow again with
  `tools/cdp-inspect.mjs` (`shot` with `CDP_FROM_SURFACE=0` for an off-screen
  window, plain `shot` plus `CDP_FRONT=1` for one that is on screen), then do the
  same against `openshow-worker` and compare. Record display topology, reported
  scale factor and window bounds alongside every capture.

## Blockers and remaining work

- No blockers. The earlier screen-lock and unplugged-DP-4 incident
  resolved itself when the user unlocked and reconnected; task 1.1 was
  accepted on the second display (see the task 1.1 log).
- Second-display hardware checks that remain open belong to their tasks:
  projector DPI and always-on-top stacking in 1.3, transitions on
  hardware later.
- Two reference questions need controlled media rather than a running FreeShow and
  are now M4 acceptance items: the pixel result of the `blur` fit with edge
  blending, and per-slide action side effects on go.
- The project's M0 note that vk-bootstrap was unused is superseded: task 1.1
  uses it.

## Exact next action

1. Start **1.2 — worker launch, RPC handshake and shutdown**: the Qt
   frontend spawns `openshow-worker --socket PATH`, they exchange the
   handshake over the Unix socket, and closing the UI shuts the worker
   down cleanly. Keep the `worker_is_qt_free` guard green.
2. Useful carry-over from 1.1: the render-test's frame-30 readback probe
   and periodic `extentOutOfDate()` recreate stay available for 1.3's
   output-window placement work.

## Resume checklist

1. Read `PLAN.md` and this file.
2. Inspect Git status/history and any existing changes.
3. Continue the current task; preserve unrelated work and the source clone.
4. Before stopping, update this file with commands, results and the next action.
